# Twenty-First Aid+

## Inspiration
Emergency first aid is unfortunately not common knowledge. More than 90% of people fail to help someone experiencing a medical emergency. This is largely due to the lack of confidence and inability to properly spot the signs of heart attack, stroke, and many other conditions that would benefit from immediate first aid. To help save more lives, we wanted to develop an educational and engaging VR experience for users to experience emergency first aid in simulated real-life scenarios.

## What it does
Our project places the user as a bystander who witnesses a lady experience a heart attack. Dr. Manny, a virtual doctor and teacher, guides the user to spot the signs of a heart attack and how to act (call 911, give aspirin, perform CPR). The game provides feedback as to whether the user is performing chest compressions at the correct rate.

## How we built it
We built Twenty-First Aid+ entirely on the Unity and C# stack, with controlled via scripting.

## Challenges we ran into
Everyone on the team had Macs which aren't the best environments to develop VR games in, so we ran into a good amount of trouble setting up Unity. Unity also had a steep learning curve with their collider logic and their physics engines. Due to how much VR development has changed in the past couple of years with the new releases of OpenVR and the Oculus Quest, a lot of documentation we ran into was outdated, and we had to rotate between multiple tutorials before landing on one that did not rely on outdated APIs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating a demo of the game that includes working narration and CPR simulation with chest compression rate feedback.

## What we learned
Through this project, we learned about the symptoms of medical emergencies (such as heart attacks, stroke, seizures, etc.) as well as the basic emergency first aid that should be performed as we wait for paramedics to arrive. We also learned how to create a virtual world in the VR headset and how to make animations in the VR.

## What's next for Twenty-First Aid+
Heart attacks are only one example of a medical emergency that could be encountered. We hope to expand our VR game to include additional types of health crisis and to emphasize the variation in victim symptoms with more scenarios. When performing CPR, implementing a CPR dummy with a pressure sensor would provide users with a more realistic experience that better prepares them. Besides the teaching tutorial, implementing a challenge mode that lacks guidance and a multiplayer mode can help users gain independence and confidence to offer immediate assistance when they witness an episode in the real-world.
